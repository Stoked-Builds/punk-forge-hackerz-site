# Kits & Hardware
Affordable, open-source, repairable kits keep every hub powered. We design for library budgets, community-centre closets, and youth-led remixing.

## MVP Lineup (Phase 0)
1. **Code + Circuits Starter** — Microcontrollers, LEDs, sensors for coding foundations.
2. **Punk Robotics Pack** — Line-follow/obstacle bots with punk styling.
3. **Noise Hacker Lab** — Contact mics, bendable toys, wearable LEDs.

## Design Principles
- Affordable & open specs (publish BOMs with price targets).
- Expandable & reusable (parts interlock across tracks, repair guides mandatory).
- Safe & inspiring (consent cues, risk notes, Day-1 wins).
- Kit-as-a-service subscription so hubs can focus on youth, not procurement.

We’ll publish full BOMs, sourcing notes, and maintenance guides here as soon as each kit finishes pilot testing.
