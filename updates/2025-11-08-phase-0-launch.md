# Phase 0 Launch — Thought Work & Planning

We kicked off Phase 0 with a simple rule: no production code, no quick wins, just ruthless clarity. Here’s what landed this week:

## 🧠 Vision & Voice
- Rebuilt the vision doc with narrative context, proof points, and public-ready pitch copy.
- Published a ten-point manifesto that keeps the punk ethos front and centre.
- Logged tone audits so future contributors know exactly how to write for Hackerz and for partners.

## 🔩 Kits & Curriculum
- Documented three kit MVPs (Code + Circuits, Punk Robotics, Noise Hacker Lab) complete with BOM targets and dependency notes.
- Added new curriculum tracks: hardware labs, AI literacy, 3D printing, vibe coding, plus age-band pathways for coding cohorts.
- Created a cross-track curriculum framework to standardise session pacing, mentor ratios, and learning loops.

## 🛡️ Community & Safety
- Expanded the Code of Conduct with reporting flows, restorative practice, and regional adaptation notes.
- Authored a mentor guide for onboarding, accessibility, and incident response.
- Laid out impact instrumentation so attendance, demographics, and reinvestment data have owners and cadences.

## 📊 Money & Metrics
- Built a transparent financial model with 1/3/5/10-year projections across low/realistic/ambitious scenarios.
- Paired it with an impact metrics plan so every pound and hour ties back to youth outcomes.

## 🗺️ Hub Strategy
- Ranked target regions across the UK with socio-economic scoring: Birmingham Eastside, Manchester NE, Glasgow East, Bolton, and Sunderland lead the list.
- Drafted regional dossiers (North-West through South-West) plus a global ranking so sequencing is data-led; summaries will be published on-site soon.

## 🤝 Partner & Pilot Prep
- Drafted the pilot proposal for a 12-week community hub, complete with budget and success metrics.
- Logged a partnerships playbook covering venue hosts, fabricators, funders, and engagement scorecards.
- Defined the post-pilot Phase 1 plan so we know what “go” looks like.

Next up: stand up the data stack (Airtable/Supabase + dashboards), lock venue partners in Manchester/Birmingham, and start pilot scouting.
