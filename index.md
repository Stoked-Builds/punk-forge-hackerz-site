# 🔥 Punk Forge Hackerz
**A movement for young makers, coders, and creators.**

Make cool stuff. Learn real skills. Change the world.  
We’re building a youth-led, open-source maker movement teaching coding, robotics, music tech, and creative hacking.

Born in **Silicon Rammy**. Built for every borough.

## Phase 0 — Thought Work & Planning
We are in a three-month slow burn focused on structure, documentation, and community readiness. No shipping, no gimmicks — just clarity.

- 🧠 [Vision & Manifesto](about.md#why-we-exist) — why we exist and the punk rules we refuse to break.
- 🗺️ [Roadmap](about.md#the-plan) — how Phase 0 unlocks pilots, Phase 1 scale, and a global commons.
- 🧰 [Kit MVPs](about.md#kits--hardware) — the first three kit lines we’re prototyping with community hubs.

## Tracks We Teach
- 🖥️ Coding & creative computing (from Scratch to Sonic Pi)
- 🤖 Robotics & hardware clinics
- 🎵 Music tech, noise labs, vibe coding
- 💥 Creative hacking, wearables, glitch art
- 🧩 Hardware rehab, AI literacy, 3D printing

## Where We’re Setting Up
We’ve scored every potential hub using deprivation data, transport links, and partner appetite. Top contenders right now:
- **Birmingham Eastside & Ladywood** — huge youth base, HS2/STEAMhouse partners.
- **Manchester North/East Corridor** — Factory/HideOut youth zones, extreme need.
- **Glasgow East / Clyde Gateway** — regeneration cash + college backing.
- **Bolton** — university STEAM centre, council STEM mandate.
- **Sunderland & Washington** — City of Culture energy, Nissan/software partners.

We’ll publish deeper regional dossiers here as soon as site visits conclude.
