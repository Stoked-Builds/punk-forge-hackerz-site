# About Punk Forge Hackerz
We are a social-enterprise maker movement teaching young people (8–18) how to hack code, hardware, sound, and systems with punk ethics instead of corporate polish.

## Why We Exist
- **Systemic gap:** Working-class, neurodivergent, and rural youth are still boxed out of creative tech.
- **Punk ethos:** DIY spirit, mutual aid, radical inclusion. If a plan breaks the manifesto, we rewrite the plan.
- **Community over commerce:** Curriculum, kits, and governance stay MIT-licensed. Every new hub keeps money cycling locally.

### Manifesto Highlights
1. Punk is a pedagogy — scribble on the lesson, remix the kit, learn by doing.
2. Youth lead, adults amplify — power flows toward the kids at the soldering iron.
3. Open source or it didn’t happen — no gatekeeping.
4. Ethics are non-negotiable — hacking as care work.
5. Momentum is sacred — every week, something new lands in the repo.

## The Plan
### Phase 0 (Now) — Thought Work & Planning
- Refine the vision, manifesto, and brand voice.
- Document kits, curriculum framework, impact metrics, and safeguarding.
- Rank hub locations, build partner pipeline, draft pilot proposal.

### Phase 1 — Local Pilots
- 3–5 hosted community hubs (libraries, youth centres) running 12-week cohorts.
- Kit-as-a-service + facilitator training bundles.
- Live impact instrumentation + transparency dashboard.

### Phase 2–3 — Network & Ventures
- Expand to 20+ hubs across the UK, then global commons.
- Punk Forge CIC ↔ Ltd ↔ Ventures loop keeps culture + capital in community hands.
- Ventures fund youth-led experiments; profits flow back into scholarships and kit R&D.

## Curriculum & Tracks
We run cross-disciplinary tracks so youth can mix tech, art, and activism:

- 🖥️ **Coding & Creative Computing** — Scratch, Python, web, automation, live coding jams.
- 🤖 **Robotics & Hardware** — Arduino, sensor rigs, assistive builds, drones.
- 🎵 **Music Tech & Vibe Coding** — Sonic Pi, Hydra, projection mapping, noise hacker labs.
- 💥 **Creative Hacking** — Wearables, glitch art, circuit bending.
- 🧠 **AI 101→Master** — Ethics-first literacy, tinyML, local LLM labs.
- 🧩 **Hardware Rehab Clinics** — Computer building, repair, and refurb fleets.
- 🧱 **3D Printing & Fabrication** — Distributed printer bank with CAD bootcamps.

Every track pairs with open-source kits, facilitator notes, and consent/safety guides in the [curriculum folder](https://github.com/Stoked-Builds/punk-forge-hackerz/tree/main/curriculum).

## Kits & Hardware
Phase 0 MVPs we’re prototyping:
1. **Code + Circuits Starter** — microcontrollers, LEDs, sensors for foundations.
2. **Punk Robotics Pack** — line-following/obstacle bots with punk styling.
3. **Noise Hacker Lab** — contact mics, circuit-bend components, wearable LEDs.

Kits are open-spec, affordable, repairable, and shipped as a subscription so hubs can focus on youth instead of procurement. Specs live in [`kit-design/mvp.md`](https://github.com/Stoked-Builds/punk-forge-hackerz/blob/main/kit-design/mvp.md).

## Safeguarding & Community Care
- **Code of Conduct:** Zero tolerance for harassment, transparent reporting channels, restorative practice steps. [`community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](https://github.com/Stoked-Builds/punk-forge-hackerz/blob/main/community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- **Mentor Guide:** Onboarding checklist, session responsibilities, inclusion practices. [`community/mentor_guide.md`](https://github.com/Stoked-Builds/punk-forge-hackerz/blob/main/community/mentor_guide.md)
- **Impact instrumentation:** Airtable + dashboards (in progress) to track attendance, demographics, skill growth, volunteer hours, and reinvestment.

## Impact & Finance
- **Metrics:** Engagement, demographic mix, project output, volunteer hours, alumni pathways, reinvestment ratio. [`planning/impact-metrics.md`](https://github.com/Stoked-Builds/punk-forge-hackerz/blob/main/planning/impact-metrics.md)
- **Financial model:** Blended revenue (grants, program fees, kit/training subscriptions, ventures). Conservative projections hit break-even within 12–18 months. [`planning/financial_model.md`](https://github.com/Stoked-Builds/punk-forge-hackerz/blob/main/planning/financial_model.md)
- **Risk posture:** Fund diversification, kit-as-a-service, hosted hubs, and strict readiness gates keep the movement resilient.

## Hub Pipeline
We’ve ranked target regions across the UK using deprivation data, transport, and partner readiness.  
Top tier: Birmingham Eastside, Manchester NE, Glasgow East, Bolton, Sunderland, Thames Gateway, Dundee, Oldham, Nottingham, Teesside.
