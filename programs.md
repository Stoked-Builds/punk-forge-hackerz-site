# Programs & Tracks
We build hybrid cohorts that mix code, hardware, music, and community briefs. Each track is open-source, remixable, and paired with facilitator notes + kit dependencies.

## Core Tracks
### 🖥️ Coding & Creative Computing
- Foundations (Scratch, Python, web basics)
- Explorer (Pygame, APIs, automation)
- Creator (full-stack builds, live coding)
- Age pathways for kids, teens, adults/elders.

### 🤖 Robotics & Hardware Clinics
- Arduino + sensor rigs, assistive devices, drones.
- Punk Robotics kit MVP for pilots.

### 🎵 Music Tech & Vibe Coding
- Sonic Pi, Hydra, projection mapping, Noise Hacker Lab.
- Live jam sessions with community performances.

### 💥 Creative Hacking
- Wearables, glitch art, circuit bending, data-driven art.

## Emerging Tracks
- 🧠 AI 101→Master (ethics-first literacy, tinyML, local LLM labs).
- 🧩 Hardware Rehab Clinics (build/repair PCs for the community).
- 🧱 3D Printing & Fabrication (distributed printer bank + CAD bootcamps).
