# Community & Safeguarding
We are a movement, not a product. Community care is infrastructure.

## Code of Conduct
- Safety first — physical, emotional, digital.
- Transparent reporting channels (`safe@punkforgehackerz.org`, anonymous form coming soon).
- Restorative actions + escalation paths documented in the [CoC](https://github.com/Stoked-Builds/punk-forge-hackerz/blob/main/community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Mentor Guide
- Onboarding checklist (manifesto, safeguarding, DBS, shadowing).
- Session responsibilities, accessibility practices, communication cadences.
- Logs tie back to impact metrics weekly. Read the [mentor guide](https://github.com/Stoked-Builds/punk-forge-hackerz/blob/main/community/mentor_guide.md).

## Impact Instrumentation
- Attendance, demographics, skill growth, volunteer hours, project counts.
- Owners & cadence defined in [`planning/impact-metrics.md`](https://github.com/Stoked-Builds/punk-forge-hackerz/blob/main/planning/impact-metrics.md).
- Data drives reinvestment and transparency dashboards (Phase 1 deliverable).

## Get Involved
- Youth & families: Email hello@punkforgehackerz.org for pilot notifications.
- Mentors: Apply via mentors@punkforgehackerz.org after reviewing the guide.
- Contributors: Submit lessons/kits via GitHub Issues tagged `phase-0`.
