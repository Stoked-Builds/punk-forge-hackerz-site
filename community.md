# Community & Safeguarding
We are a movement, not a product. Community care is infrastructure.

## Code of Conduct
- Safety first — physical, emotional, digital.
- Transparent reporting channels (`safe@punkforgehackerz.org`, anonymous form coming soon).
- Restorative actions + escalation paths documented in the CoC (publishing here soon).

## Mentor Guide
- Onboarding checklist (manifesto, safeguarding, DBS, shadowing).
- Session responsibilities, accessibility practices, communication cadences.
- Logs tie back to impact metrics weekly. We’ll share the full mentor pack on this site once it clears legal review.

## Impact Instrumentation
- Attendance, demographics, skill growth, volunteer hours, project counts.
- Owners & cadence defined so every hub knows what to log and when.
- Data drives reinvestment and transparency dashboards (Phase 1 deliverable).

## Get Involved
- Youth & families: Email hello@punkforgehackerz.org for pilot notifications.
- Mentors: Apply via mentors@punkforgehackerz.org after reviewing the guide.
- Contributors: Submit lessons/kits via GitHub Issues tagged `phase-0`.
